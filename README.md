## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

I originally worked on authentication and session-related concepts during FreeCodeCampâ€™s backend certification. While it covered the basics, I felt the knowledge didnâ€™t fully stick â€” and I wanted to deeply understand how real backend systems manage things like sessions, cookies, and user flows.

So I built this project from scratch using TypeScript, simulating a realistic auth workflow (login, session creation, protected access) **without using a server or database**.

This was my way of **cementing core backend concepts** in a hands-on, architectural way â€” and preparing myself for more complex fullstack work going forward.
